#Why

After changing laptops/VM many times, I grew tired of
reinstalling all of my stuff all the times, hence the
creation of a git repo to hold my configuration files
and a simple shell script to download and install the
tools I need for my everyday task a software engineer

#How

Either copy manually the . files or run :

`./install.sh [installation_path]`

[The installation_path] is optionnal, it will be the directory
where the sources are downloaded and built (Vim and Git for instance)

#TODO

 * Import tmux configuration
 * Install the following VIM plugins: YouCompleteMe, cscope-maps
 * Add the packages for the linters: pylint, jshint
