#Why

After changing laptops/VM many times, I grew tired of
reinstalling all of my stuff all the times, hence the
creation of a git repo to hold my configuration files
and a simple shell script to download and install the
tools I need for my everyday task a software engineer

#How

Either copy manually the . files or run install.sh

#TODO

Use ln instead of cp for the configuration files in
the install script, that way when updating this
repository, the configuration files in my home will
get updated too.
