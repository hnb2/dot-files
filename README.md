#Why

After changing laptops/VM many times, I grew tired of
reinstalling all of my stuff all the times, hence the
creation of a git repo to hold my configuration files
and a simple shell script to download and install the
tools I need for my everyday task a software engineer

#How

Either copy manually the . files or run `./install.sh`

#TODO

 * Take the installation path as a parameter in install.sh
 * Import tmux configuration
 * Install the following VIM plugins: YouCompleteMe, cscope-maps
 * Add the packages for the linters: pylint, jshint
